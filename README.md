# About

A simple mod that adds the ability to catch fish from rivers, lakes and oceans. There are several tiers of fishing nets that catch fish over time. Fishing nets also occasionally break, with basic wooden fishing nets only lasting a couple of days.

In addition there is an option to build a fishing net on ice, to reap the benefits of the ocean under the ice.
